Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that can be used to sort an array of values in ascending or descending order.

Here's how it works:

You start by comparing the first two elements of the array. If the first element is greater than the second element, you swap them. Otherwise, you leave them as they are.

Then you move on to the next pair of elements in the array and repeat the same process, comparing and swapping if necessary.

You keep doing this until you reach the end of the array. At this point, the largest element will have "bubbled up" to the end of the array.

You then repeat the process, but this time only going up to the second-to-last element in the array. This is because the last element is already in its correct position.

You keep repeating this process, each time stopping one element sooner, until the entire array is sorted.

Bubble sort gets its name from the way that the larger elements "bubble up" to the top of the array. It's not the most efficient sorting algorithm out there, but it's relatively easy to understand and implement.

example pseudocode:
array = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]

n = len(array)
for i = 0 to n-1
    for j = 0 to n-i-2
        if array[j] > array[j+1] then
            // Swap the two elements
            temp = array[j]
            array[j] = array[j+1]
            array[j+1] = temp
        endif
    next j
next i

OUTPUT "Sorted array:"
for i = 0 to n-1
   OUTPUT array[i]
next
